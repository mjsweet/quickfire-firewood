There is nothing quite like the taste of a wood-fired pizza. That signature char on the crust, the smoky depth of flavour, and the way the cheese bubbles and browns in just the right places. But here is something many home pizza enthusiasts discover the hard way: the wood you choose makes all the difference.

After years of supplying firewood to pizza oven owners across Brisbane and the Gold Coast, we have learned exactly what separates a disappointing cook from a perfect one. In this guide, we will share everything you need to know about choosing the right firewood for your pizza oven.

## Why Your Firewood Choice Matters

Your pizza oven needs to reach temperatures between 400 and 500 degrees Celsius for authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas. Achieving and maintaining these temperatures depends entirely on your fuel source.

The wrong wood can mean:
- Struggling to reach proper cooking temperatures
- Excessive smoke that taints your food
- Inconsistent heat that leads to unevenly cooked bases
- Dangerous sparking and popping
- Rapid burnout requiring constant fuel additions

The right wood delivers:
- Quick, efficient heat buildup
- Clean burning with minimal smoke
- Sustained high temperatures
- Safe, predictable combustion
- Better flavour in your finished pizza

## Hardwood vs Softwood: Understanding the Basics

This is the most fundamental distinction in firewood selection, and it matters enormously for pizza ovens.

### Hardwood

Hardwoods come from deciduous and slow-growing trees. They are denser, burn longer, and produce significantly more heat per kilogram. For pizza ovens, hardwood is the clear choice.

Premium hardwoods like [Western Ironbark](/firewood/pizza-ovens) are particularly well-suited because they:
- Burn at extremely high temperatures
- Produce long-lasting coals that maintain oven heat
- Generate minimal smoke once established
- Resist sparking and spitting

### Softwood

Softwoods like pine and other conifers are lighter, burn quickly, and produce more smoke and sparks. They also contain resins that can create unpleasant flavours and leave residue in your oven. We recommend avoiding softwood entirely for pizza cooking.

## The Best Wood Species for Pizza Ovens

Not all hardwoods are created equal. Here are the top performers we recommend.

### Western Ironbark

This is our speciality, and there is good reason we focus on it. Western Ironbark is one of the densest, hottest-burning hardwoods available in Australia. It reaches pizza oven temperatures quickly, maintains heat for extended cooking sessions, and produces a subtle, clean smoke that enhances rather than overwhelms your food.

For serious pizza enthusiasts and [commercial pizza restaurants](/commercial), Ironbark consistently delivers professional results.

### Other Suitable Hardwoods

While Ironbark is our recommendation, other quality hardwoods can work well:
- **Red Gum**: Burns hot with good coal production
- **Box**: Dense and long-burning
- **Stringybark**: Reliable heat output

The key is ensuring whatever species you choose is properly seasoned and sourced from a reputable supplier.

## Moisture Content: The Critical Factor

Even the best wood species will perform poorly if it is not properly dried. This is where many pizza oven owners encounter problems.

### What is Seasoned Firewood?

Seasoning refers to the drying process that reduces the moisture content of freshly cut wood. Green (unseasoned) wood can contain 50% or more moisture by weight. Properly seasoned wood should have moisture content below 20%, ideally around 12-15%.

### Why Moisture Matters

Wet wood creates several problems in a pizza oven:
- **Energy waste**: Heat energy goes toward evaporating water rather than heating your oven
- **Lower temperatures**: You simply cannot achieve proper pizza cooking temperatures
- **Excessive smoke**: Wet wood smoulders rather than burns cleanly
- **Difficult ignition**: Getting a fire started becomes frustrating
- **Creosote buildup**: Moisture promotes dangerous tar deposits in your chimney

### How to Identify Properly Seasoned Wood

Look for these signs:
- Cracks radiating from the centre of the log ends
- Lighter weight compared to fresh-cut wood
- Greyish colouration on the cut surfaces
- A hollow sound when two pieces are knocked together
- The bark separates easily or has already fallen off

At Quickfire Firewood, we season our [Ironbark for a minimum of 12 months](/about) before sale. This ensures you receive wood that is ready to deliver optimal performance.

## Size and Split Considerations

The physical dimensions of your firewood matter more than you might expect.

### Ideal Sizing for Pizza Ovens

Pizza ovens typically have smaller fireboxes than conventional fireplaces. You need wood that:
- Fits comfortably in your oven opening
- Allows adequate airflow around the pieces
- Ignites quickly and builds heat rapidly

For most domestic pizza ovens, splits of 20-30cm in length and 5-8cm in diameter work best. Smaller kindling (2-4cm diameter) is essential for getting your fire started.

### Custom Splitting

One advantage of working with a quality supplier is the option for custom sizing. We offer [custom splitting to your specifications](/order), ensuring the wood fits your specific oven design perfectly.

## Practical Tips for Pizza Oven Success

Beyond choosing the right wood, these practices will help you achieve consistently excellent results.

### Building Your Fire

Start with a small kindling fire in the centre of your oven. Once established, gradually add larger pieces. Allow the fire to spread across the oven floor before pushing it to one side for cooking.

### Managing the Flames

For pizza cooking, you want an active fire with dancing flames, not just glowing coals. The flames are essential for cooking the top of your pizza quickly.

### Temperature Monitoring

Invest in an infrared thermometer. Pizza oven cooking requires precision, and guesswork leads to inconsistent results. Most pizzas cook best when the floor temperature is around 400 degrees Celsius and the dome is slightly hotter.

### Storage Best Practices

Even perfectly seasoned wood can absorb moisture if stored poorly. In Queensland's climate, [proper storage](/blog/2026-03-28-how-to-store-firewood-properly-in-queenslands-climate) means keeping your wood elevated, covered from rain, but with good airflow.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Through our conversations with customers, we see these errors repeatedly:

1. **Using construction offcuts**: Treated timber releases toxic fumes when burned
2. **Burning painted or stained wood**: Similarly dangerous
3. **Choosing convenience over quality**: Cheap, unseasoned wood costs more in wasted fuel and poor results
4. **Overcrowding the oven**: Too much wood restricts airflow and smothers the fire
5. **Impatience**: Rushing the heating phase leads to uneven cooking
