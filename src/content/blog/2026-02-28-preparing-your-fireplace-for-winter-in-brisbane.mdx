Brisbane winters are mild compared to southern states, but when those crisp evenings arrive, there is nothing quite like gathering around a crackling fire. Whether you have a traditional open fireplace or a modern enclosed wood heater, a little preparation goes a long way toward ensuring safe, efficient heating throughout the cooler months.

As firewood suppliers who have served Brisbane households for years, we have learned what distinguishes a trouble-free winter from one plagued by smoking fireplaces, poor heat output, and safety concerns. This guide will walk you through everything you need to do before lighting that first fire of the season.

## Why Pre-Winter Preparation Matters

Many Brisbane residents use their fireplaces only four to five months per year. During the warmer months, chimneys sit dormant, accumulating dust, debris, and sometimes uninvited guests. Attempting to use an unserviced fireplace can result in:

- Smoke backing into your home
- Poor draft and inefficient burning
- Potential chimney fires from creosote buildup
- Animal blockages creating dangerous conditions
- Unpleasant odours from accumulated debris

Taking time to prepare properly ensures your fireplace operates safely and efficiently when you need it most.

## Step 1: Visual Inspection

Before calling a professional or climbing on your roof, conduct a basic visual inspection.

### Interior Check

Look inside your fireplace for:
- **Debris accumulation**: Leaves, twigs, or nesting materials
- **Soot buildup**: Thick black deposits on the walls
- **Damper operation**: Ensure it opens and closes freely
- **Firebox condition**: Check for cracked bricks or deteriorating mortar
- **Grate condition**: Look for rust, warping, or broken bars

### Exterior Check

From outside, examine:
- **Chimney cap condition**: Ensure it is intact and secure
- **Visible cracks**: In the chimney structure or flashing
- **Bird or possum activity**: Signs of nesting around the chimney top
- **Overgrown vegetation**: Trees or vines too close to the chimney

## Step 2: Professional Chimney Cleaning

Even if everything looks acceptable during your inspection, annual professional cleaning is essential. Chimney sweeps have specialised tools and expertise to:

### Remove Creosote Buildup

Creosote is the tarry residue that accumulates when wood burns incompletely. It is highly flammable and responsible for most chimney fires. Professional cleaning removes this dangerous buildup before it reaches hazardous levels.

### Clear Blockages

Birds, possums, and other wildlife frequently nest in dormant chimneys. A professional sweep can safely remove these blockages and install caps or guards to prevent future problems.

### Identify Hidden Issues

Experienced chimney technicians can spot problems invisible to homeowners: cracks in the flue liner, deteriorating mortar joints, or structural issues that could become dangerous.

### When to Book

In Brisbane, aim to have your chimney serviced in March or April, before the winter rush. Chimney sweeps become busy once cold weather arrives, and waiting until then might mean delays when you actually want to use your fireplace.

## Step 3: Stock Your Firewood Supply

With your fireplace serviced and ready, it is time to think about fuel. The quality of firewood you burn directly impacts your comfort, safety, and how often you need to clean your chimney.

### Why Wood Quality Matters

Poor quality firewood creates problems:
- **Wet wood** burns inefficiently, produces excessive smoke, and accelerates creosote buildup
- **Softwoods** burn quickly, requiring constant refuelling, and generate more sparks
- **Mixed or unknown species** deliver inconsistent heat and unpredictable burning characteristics

### Choosing the Right Firewood

For Brisbane [fireplaces and wood heaters](/firewood/fireplaces), we recommend properly seasoned hardwood, particularly Western Ironbark. Quality firewood should be:

- **Seasoned for 12 months minimum**: Moisture content below 20%
- **Identified species**: Know what you are burning
- **Properly sized**: Appropriate for your fireplace dimensions
- **Cleanly split**: Consistent sizing for predictable burning

### How Much to Order

A typical Brisbane winter season (May through September) might require:
- **Occasional users**: 1-2 cubic metres
- **Regular users**: 3-4 cubic metres
- **Daily users**: 5+ cubic metres

Ordering early in autumn often means better availability and allows time for the wood to air further if needed.

## Step 4: Prepare Your Storage Area

Where and how you store firewood significantly affects its burning quality. Queensland's subtropical climate presents unique challenges.

### Essential Storage Principles

- **Elevate the stack**: Use a raised platform or pallets to prevent ground moisture absorption
- **Cover the top**: Protect from rain while allowing airflow
- **Leave sides open**: Air circulation prevents mould and continues the drying process
- **Position for convenience**: Easy access encourages regular use
- **Keep away from the house**: Stored wood can harbour insects; maintain at least a metre clearance from walls

### Managing Queensland's Humidity

Our humid summers can affect stored firewood. If your wood has been sitting through a wet summer, check it before use. Well-seasoned wood will not reabsorb much moisture if properly stored, but exposed wood may need additional drying time.

For detailed storage guidance specific to our climate, see our guide on [storing firewood in Queensland's climate](/blog/2026-03-28-how-to-store-firewood-properly-in-queenslands-climate).

## Step 5: Gather Essential Accessories

The right tools make fireplace operation safer and more enjoyable.

### Necessary Items

- **Fireside tool set**: Poker, tongs, shovel, and brush
- **Fire screen**: Essential for open fireplaces to contain sparks
- **Kindling**: Small dry sticks or commercial firelighters
- **Ash bucket with lid**: Metal, for safe ash removal
- **Matches or long lighter**: Keep them dry and accessible

### Nice to Have

- **Log carrier**: Makes transporting wood cleaner and easier
- **Moisture meter**: Verify your wood is properly dry
- **Hearth rug**: Protects flooring from sparks and dropped wood

## Step 6: Test Before You Need It

Do not wait until a cold evening to discover problems. On a mild autumn day, conduct a test burn.

### Testing Procedure

1. Ensure the damper is fully open
2. Build a small fire using dry kindling and one or two small logs
3. Watch for smoke behaviour - it should draw up the chimney, not into the room
4. Listen for unusual sounds
5. Check the draft feels strong and consistent
6. After extinguishing, inspect for any concerning odours

If you notice problems during testing, you have time to address them before winter properly arrives.

## Step 7: Review Safety Practices

Before using your fireplace regularly, refresh your household on fire safety.

### Essential Safety Rules

- **Never leave a fire unattended**: Especially with children or pets present
- **Use a fireguard**: Mandatory for open fireplaces
- **Check smoke alarms**: Test batteries and replace units older than 10 years
- **Keep combustibles clear**: Furniture, curtains, and decorations should be well away from the heat
- **Dispose of ash safely**: Wait 24 hours minimum, use a metal container, store outside

### Teaching Children

If children live in or visit your home, establish clear rules about fireplace safety. The fireplace area should be off-limits to unsupervised children, and they should understand fire is not a toy.

## Common Brisbane Fireplace Issues

Through our work with local customers, we frequently hear about these problems.

### Smoking Back Into the Room

Often caused by:
- Cold chimney (light a small warm-up fire first)
- Closed or partially closed damper
- Blocked flue
- Negative air pressure in the house (try opening a window slightly)

### Struggling to Start

Usually indicates:
- Wet or unseasoned wood
- Insufficient kindling
- Poor airflow to the fire

### Fire Burns Out Quickly

Typically means:
- Wood pieces too small
- Softwood being used
- Excessive draft pulling heat up the chimney

## Making the Most of Your Fireplace

Beyond the practical warmth, a fireplace adds atmosphere and becomes a focal point for family gatherings. Here are ways to maximise enjoyment:

- **Create ambiance**: Keep the area tidy and consider fireplace-appropriate decorations
- **Establish rituals**: Lighting the fire can become a pleasant evening routine
- **Share the task**: Teach older children to safely tend the fire
- **Combine with entertaining**: A [fire pit outdoors](/firewood/fire-pits) extends the experience to alfresco gatherings
