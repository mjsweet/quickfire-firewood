Few things bring people together like gathering around an open fire. Whether you are hosting a winter barbecue, celebrating with friends, or simply enjoying a quiet evening with family, a fire pit creates an atmosphere that no other outdoor feature can match.

But with open flames comes responsibility. Every year, preventable accidents occur because basic safety practices were overlooked. As firewood suppliers who speak with fire pit owners daily, we want everyone to enjoy their outdoor fires safely.

This guide covers essential safety considerations for backyard fire pit use in Brisbane and South East Queensland.

## Before You Light: Location and Setup

Safety begins long before you strike a match. Where and how you position your fire pit determines your baseline safety level.

### Distance From Structures

Keep your fire pit at least three metres from:
- Your house and any outbuildings
- Fences (especially timber)
- Pergolas, decking, and covered outdoor areas
- Trees with overhanging branches
- Garden beds with mulch or dry vegetation

Embers can travel surprisingly far, especially on windy evenings. What feels like a safe distance in calm conditions may be inadequate when a breeze picks up.

### Ground Surface

The ideal surface beneath your fire pit is:
- Non-combustible (concrete, pavers, gravel, bare earth)
- Level and stable
- Away from areas where spilled fuel could pool

Avoid placing fire pits on:
- Timber decking (even with protection)
- Artificial grass
- Dry lawn during fire season
- Painted or sealed concrete (can discolour or crack)

If your preferred location has a combustible surface, consider a fire pit mat or relocating to safer ground.

### Clearance Above

Look up before you set up. Ensure there are no:
- Low-hanging branches (even dead branches can catch)
- Awnings, shade sails, or umbrellas
- Power lines or cables
- Clotheslines

A clear overhead space prevents burning debris from igniting something above.

## Fire Pit Selection and Maintenance

The type of fire pit you use and its condition directly affect safety.

### Choosing a Suitable Fire Pit

Quality fire pits feature:
- **Stable construction**: No risk of tipping over
- **Adequate depth**: Contains fuel and coals securely
- **Proper ventilation**: Burns efficiently without excessive smoke
- **Heat-resistant materials**: Cast iron, steel, or purpose-built stone

Avoid improvised containers like old washing machine drums or thin-gauge metal that can rust through and collapse.

### Regular Inspection

Before each use, check for:
- Rust holes or weakened sections
- Unstable legs or supports
- Accumulated ash restricting airflow
- Cracks in stone or masonry pits

Replace or repair compromised fire pits before using them again.

### Ash Management

Remove old ash before it accumulates beyond a few centimetres. Excessive ash restricts airflow and can insulate buried coals, keeping them dangerously hot for extended periods.

Dispose of ash in a metal container with a lid, stored away from combustibles. Ash can remain hot enough to start fires for 24 hours or more.

## Fuel Selection and Handling

What you burn significantly affects both safety and enjoyment.

### Use Only Suitable Fuel

Safe fire pit fuel includes:
- Properly seasoned hardwood (like [Ironbark for fire pits](/firewood/fire-pits))
- Untreated timber offcuts
- Commercial firelighters (follow package directions)

Never burn:
- **Treated or painted wood**: Releases toxic fumes
- **Household rubbish**: Unpredictable combustion, dangerous fumes
- **Plastic or rubber**: Toxic smoke, difficult to control
- **Accelerants like petrol**: Extremely dangerous, can cause flash fires
- **Magazines or coated paper**: Float as burning embers

### Starting Your Fire

Build your fire using the pyramid or log cabin method:
1. Place crumpled newspaper or firelighters at the base
2. Add kindling in a loose arrangement
3. Place small splits around the kindling
4. Light from multiple points
5. Add larger pieces once the fire is established

Avoid using accelerants to start fires. If your fire will not light, the wood may be wet, the kindling insufficient, or airflow restricted.

### Maintaining the Fire

Add fuel gradually rather than piling on large amounts. Overstoked fires:
- Produce excessive sparks and embers
- Become difficult to control
- May overflow the pit
- Create dangerously high flames

For a comfortable gathering, moderate flames and a bed of glowing coals provide better ambiance than a roaring inferno.

## During Use: Supervision and Control

Active supervision is essential whenever a fire is burning.

### Never Leave Unattended

This is the most important rule. An unattended fire can:
- Spread to surrounding vegetation
- Produce dangerous sparks without warning
- Attract curious children or pets
- Become uncontrollable if conditions change

Designate someone as fire watcher at all times. If you need to go inside, another responsible adult must take over.

### Keep Children and Pets at a Safe Distance

Establish a clear boundary, at least two metres from the fire pit, that children and pets cannot cross. Fire pits remain dangerous long after flames die down; the structure and coals retain extreme heat.

Explain fire safety rules to children before events. Younger children should be supervised constantly around outdoor fires.

### Alcohol and Fire Do Not Mix Well

Be mindful when alcohol is involved in your gathering. Impaired judgment leads to:
- People sitting or standing too close
- Unsafe fuel being thrown on the fire
- Forgotten supervision duties
- Inappropriate fire management attempts

If guests are drinking, ensure a sober person maintains fire responsibility throughout.

### Managing Smoke

Excessive smoke usually indicates:
- Wet or unseasoned wood
- Insufficient airflow
- Smouldering rather than burning

Quality [seasoned firewood](/about) burns cleaner with less smoke. Position seating upwind when possible, and advise guests with respiratory sensitivities.

## Weather Considerations

Brisbane's climate presents specific fire pit considerations.

### Wind

On windy days, sparks and embers travel further and fires become harder to control. Consider postponing if:
- Wind speed exceeds 20 km/h
- Gusts are unpredictable
- Conditions are dry and vegetation is susceptible

Even moderate wind requires increased vigilance and may warrant reducing fire size.

### Fire Bans and Restrictions

During declared fire danger periods, open burning may be prohibited or restricted. Check local council regulations and fire service announcements before lighting.

In Brisbane, fire bans typically coincide with hot, dry, windy conditions in spring and summer. Fines apply for lighting fires during total fire bans.

### Rain and After Rain

Light rain usually does not prevent safe fire pit use. However:
- Wet wood burns poorly and creates excessive smoke
- Sudden heavy rain can cause dangerous sizzling and steam
- Wet surfaces around the pit may become slippery

Ensure your firewood is stored dry regardless of weather conditions. Read our guide on [storing firewood in Queensland's climate](/blog/2026-03-28-how-to-store-firewood-properly-in-queenslands-climate) for best practices.

## Emergency Preparedness

Despite best precautions, emergencies can occur. Be prepared.

### Fire Extinguishing Options

Have one or more of these readily available:
- Garden hose connected and tested
- Fire extinguisher (suitable for wood fires)
- Bucket of sand
- Fire blanket

Know where they are and how to use them before lighting the fire.

### First Aid

Keep a basic first aid kit accessible, including burn treatment supplies. Know how to respond to:
- Minor burns (cool with water for 20 minutes)
- Clothing catching fire (stop, drop, roll)
- Smoke inhalation (move to fresh air)

For serious burns or injuries, call 000 immediately.

### Emergency Numbers

Have emergency contact numbers accessible:
- Triple Zero (000) for fire, ambulance, police
- Poisons Information Centre (13 11 26) if toxic fumes inhaled

## Extinguishing Your Fire

Properly extinguishing your fire is as important as safely starting it.

### Allow Time

Do not wait until you want to go to bed to begin extinguishing. The process takes time.

### Step-by-Step

1. Stop adding fuel at least two hours before you need the fire out
2. Allow flames to die down and wood to burn to coals
3. Spread coals with a poker to increase surface area
4. Apply water slowly and thoroughly, working from the edges inward
5. Stir and apply more water until hissing stops
6. Test by hovering your hand above (not on) the ash; no heat should radiate
7. Consider covering with damp sand if in doubt

Never leave a fire pit with active coals overnight, even in contained metal pits.

## Neighbourhood Considerations

Fire pit use affects those around you.

### Smoke Management

Dense smoke drifting into neighbours' properties causes legitimate complaints. Minimise smoke by:
- Using properly seasoned wood
- Maintaining hot, active fires rather than smouldering
- Positioning the pit considering prevailing wind direction

If neighbours have concerns, open communication usually resolves issues.

### Noise and Hours

Evening gatherings can extend late around a fire pit. Be mindful of local noise regulations and neighbourhood expectations, particularly on weeknights.
