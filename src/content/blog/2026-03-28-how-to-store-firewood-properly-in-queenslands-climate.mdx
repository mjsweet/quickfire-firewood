You have invested in quality firewood. Now the challenge is keeping it in peak condition until you need it. Queensland's subtropical climate creates specific storage challenges that differ from cooler, drier regions of Australia. Understanding these challenges and implementing proper storage practices protects your firewood investment and ensures optimal performance when you light that fire.

As Brisbane firewood suppliers, we frequently advise customers on storage best practices. Here is everything you need to know about keeping your firewood in excellent condition.

## Why Proper Storage Matters

Firewood quality can improve or deteriorate in storage. Proper storage:
- Continues the seasoning process, reducing moisture content further
- Prevents moisture reabsorption from rain and humidity
- Discourages pest infestations
- Reduces mould and fungal growth
- Maintains clean-burning characteristics
- Preserves heat output potential

Poor storage reverses these benefits, potentially ruining even premium firewood.

## Queensland's Climate Challenges

South East Queensland presents unique firewood storage challenges compared to southern states.

### High Humidity

Brisbane experiences humidity levels that would be considered extreme in Melbourne or Adelaide. Summer humidity regularly exceeds 70%, and even winter brings periods of elevated moisture in the air.

This humidity means firewood can absorb atmospheric moisture even without direct rain exposure. Properly dried wood stored in continuously humid conditions can reabsorb enough water to compromise burning quality.

### Heavy Rainfall

Queensland's rainfall patterns include sudden, heavy downpours that can saturate unprotected wood surprisingly quickly. Summer storms often arrive without warning, and wet seasons can bring extended periods of damp conditions.

### Pest Pressure

Queensland's warm climate supports year-round pest activity. Termites, borers, and other wood-damaging insects remain active throughout the year, unlike southern regions where cold weather reduces pest pressure.

### Mould and Fungal Growth

The combination of warmth and humidity creates ideal conditions for mould and fungal growth on organic materials including firewood. Left unchecked, these can compromise wood quality and create health concerns when burned.

## Essential Storage Principles

These fundamentals apply regardless of specific setup.

### Elevation

Never store firewood directly on the ground. Ground contact allows:
- Moisture absorption from soil
- Easier pest access
- Fungal growth from below
- Accelerated decomposition of bottom layers

Minimum elevation of 10-15 centimetres is essential. Purpose-built racks, concrete blocks, or pallets all work effectively.

### Air Circulation

Airflow around your woodpile is critical in humid climates. Good circulation:
- Carries moisture away from wood surfaces
- Discourages mould establishment
- Helps prevent pest harbourage
- Continues the drying process

Stack wood with small gaps between pieces rather than tightly packed. Leave space between the stack and any walls or fences.

### Rain Protection

The top of your stack must be protected from rain. Options include:
- Purpose-built firewood shelter with roof
- Tarpaulin or plastic sheeting
- Metal roofing sheets positioned over the stack
- Location under existing covered areas

Important: Cover only the top, not the sides. Wrapping firewood entirely traps moisture and promotes the very problems you are trying to prevent.

### Sun Exposure

In Queensland, some sun exposure benefits firewood by:
- Promoting surface drying
- Discouraging mould growth
- Warming wood for faster moisture evaporation

However, excessive sun exposure in our intense climate can cause surface checking (cracks) in some species. Partial shade or dappled sunlight is often ideal.

## Location Selection

Where you position your firewood storage affects outcomes significantly.

### Distance From the House

While convenient access is desirable, storing wood against the house creates problems:
- Provides pest pathways to your home, particularly termites
- Can trap moisture against walls
- May violate building codes regarding combustible materials
- Creates fire risk from stored fuel against structures

Position storage at least two metres from house walls, and preferably further.

### Drainage

Avoid low-lying areas where water pools after rain. Even elevated stacks suffer if sitting in water. Choose ground that slopes away or drains quickly.

### Access

You will be accessing this storage throughout winter, potentially in dark or wet conditions. Ensure:
- Clear pathway from house to storage
- Adequate lighting or simple torch access
- Proximity that encourages use rather than discouraging it

### Prevailing Wind

In Brisbane, summer storms typically approach from the southwest while winter winds often come from the west. Position your cover to protect against the most common weather direction.

## Building a Firewood Storage Solution

From simple to sophisticated, here are workable approaches for Queensland conditions.

### Basic Pallet Stack

**Cost**: Minimal
**Effectiveness**: Adequate for smaller quantities

1. Place pallets on level ground, ensuring stability
2. Stack firewood in rows on pallets, bark-side up where possible
3. Leave finger-width gaps between pieces
4. Cover top with weighted tarpaulin, leaving ends open

This works for a few cubic metres stored for one season.

### Firewood Rack with Roof

**Cost**: Moderate ($100-$300)
**Effectiveness**: Good for ongoing storage

Commercial or DIY firewood racks provide proper elevation and structure. Adding a simple corrugated roof creates excellent protection while maintaining airflow.

Key features:
- Metal frame resists moisture better than timber
- Sloped roof sheds water effectively
- Open sides maintain circulation
- Stable construction handles Queensland storms

### Purpose-Built Firewood Shed

**Cost**: Higher ($500-$1500+)
**Effectiveness**: Excellent

For serious firewood users, a dedicated storage structure offers:
- Complete rain protection
- Secure storage
- Multi-season capacity
- Pest barriers if properly constructed
- Organisation for different wood types or sizes

Design should prioritise ventilation over sealing; a firewood shed is not a sealed room.

## Stacking Techniques

How you arrange wood within your storage affects drying and preservation.

### Standard Row Stacking

Stack pieces in roughly parallel rows, alternating direction each layer. This creates stability while maintaining air gaps. Avoid overly neat stacking that eliminates circulation.

### Cross-Stacking at Ends

Build end pillars using cross-stacked wood (log cabin style) to contain longer rows. This provides stability without needing end boards while keeping the structure freestanding.

### Bark Position

For seasoning wood, stack bark-side down to allow moisture to escape from the exposed surface.

For seasoned wood in weather-exposed locations, bark-side up provides some natural water shedding.

### Size Segregation

If you use different wood sizes for different purposes, such as [kindling versus larger pieces for your fireplace](/firewood/fireplaces) or [specific sizes for pizza ovens](/firewood/pizza-ovens), storing them separately simplifies access.

## Seasonal Considerations

Queensland's seasons affect storage differently than southern climates.

### Summer (December to February)

Peak humidity and storm season. Focus on:
- Ensuring rain covers are secure before storms
- Checking for mould or fungal growth monthly
- Monitoring for increased pest activity
- Using any remaining old stock before new purchases

### Autumn (March to May)

Transitional period with decreasing humidity. Ideal time to:
- Purchase firewood for winter
- Allow new purchases to air further
- Prepare and maintain storage structures
- Clear vegetation around storage areas

### Winter (June to August)

Primary usage period. Our driest season makes storage easier, but:
- Monitor stock levels
- Bring wood inside a day before use for optimal dryness
- Keep access paths clear
- Ensure [your fireplace is ready](/blog/2026-02-28-preparing-your-fireplace-for-winter-in-brisbane) for the season

### Spring (September to November)

Increasing warmth and occasional storms. Focus on:
- Assessing remaining stock quality
- Planning end-of-season storage
- Maintaining termite vigilance as activity increases

## Pest Management

Queensland's pest pressure requires ongoing attention.

### Termite Prevention

Termites pose the greatest threat to stored firewood in our region. Reduce risk by:
- Never storing wood against buildings
- Maintaining clear space beneath the stack
- Regular visual inspection of stack surroundings
- Using metal or concrete supports rather than timber posts
- Being alert to mud trails or damaged wood

### Borer Control

Borers can establish in stored firewood, particularly in wood stored for extended periods. Minimise risk by:
- Rotating stock (use oldest first)
- Not storing more than one season's supply
- Inspecting for exit holes when selecting wood to burn

### General Pest Discouragement

Firewood stacks can harbour spiders, snakes, and other creatures. When selecting wood:
- Wear gloves
- Be cautious reaching into stacks
- Tap or shift pieces before grabbing
- Use torchlight in dim conditions

## How Much to Store

Queensland's relatively mild winters mean less firewood consumption than cooler climates. Consider:

### Typical Requirements

- **Occasional use**: 1-2 cubic metres per season
- **Regular evening fires**: 3-4 cubic metres
- **Daily heating supplementation**: 5+ cubic metres
- **Commercial or intensive use**: [Contact us](/commercial) for bulk supply guidance

### Storage Capacity vs Need

Store slightly more than you expect to use, allowing for unexpectedly cold weeks or extended entertaining. However, massive stockpiles create:
- More pest exposure
- Longer storage periods promoting deterioration
- Unnecessary capital tied up in fuel
- More maintenance requirements

One season's supply, perhaps 20% above expected needs, is the practical sweet spot for most households.

## Bringing Wood Inside

A small quantity of wood inside creates convenient access and ensures thoroughly dry fuel.

### Indoor Storage Limits

Keep only what you will use within a few days. Larger indoor quantities:
- May harbour pests
- Create mess from bark and debris
- Represent fire risk near heat sources

A dedicated wood basket or small rack near your [fireplace](/firewood/fireplaces) or [fire pit](/firewood/fire-pits) access point is ideal.

### Pre-Use Drying

Bringing wood inside 24-48 hours before burning allows final moisture equilibration to indoor humidity levels. This produces cleaner ignition and better initial combustion.

## Quality Firewood Makes Storage Easier

Properly seasoned wood from a [reliable supplier](/about) is easier to store successfully than green or poorly prepared wood. When you purchase from Quickfire Firewood, you receive Ironbark that has already been seasoned for a minimum of 12 months, giving you a head start on quality.
