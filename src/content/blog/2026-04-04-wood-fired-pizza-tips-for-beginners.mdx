You have invested in a wood-fired pizza oven. You have watched countless videos of perfect pizzas sliding out of glowing ovens, cheese bubbling, crusts blistered and charred in all the right places. Now it is time to make it happen.

The gap between those inspiring videos and your first attempts can feel frustrating. But here is the encouraging truth: wood-fired pizza is not as difficult as it might seem. With sound fundamentals and a little practice, you will be producing impressive results within a few sessions.

We supply firewood to pizza enthusiasts across Brisbane and the Gold Coast, from complete beginners to experienced cooks. Here are the tips that help new pizza makers progress fastest.

## Understanding Your Oven

Every wood-fired oven behaves slightly differently. Spend time understanding yours before expecting perfection.

### Domestic vs Commercial Design

Home pizza ovens typically run smaller than commercial units. This affects:
- How much wood you can burn at once
- Heat-up time requirements
- Number of pizzas you can cook between fuel additions
- Recovery time between pizzas

Read your oven's documentation, but also observe its behaviour during use.

### Heat Zones

Wood-fired ovens have distinct temperature zones:
- **Fire side**: Hottest, where flames are active
- **Dome directly above fire**: Extremely hot from radiated heat
- **Floor opposite fire**: Cooking zone for pizza
- **Door area**: Coolest, where heat escapes

Understanding these zones helps you manage the cooking process.

### Learning the Signs

Experienced pizza cooks read their oven through:
- **Dome colour**: White dome indicates proper temperature; dark dome means more heat needed
- **Floor appearance**: Clean, ash-free floor ready for pizza
- **Flame behaviour**: Active flames licking the dome needed for topping cooking
- **Sound**: The crackle of a well-established fire versus the hiss of struggling combustion

These sensory cues become natural with practice.

## Fire Management Fundamentals

The fire is everything. Master it, and pizza success follows.

### Fuel Selection

Wood choice significantly impacts results. [Quality hardwood like Ironbark](/firewood/pizza-ovens) provides:
- Rapid heat buildup to cooking temperatures
- Sustained high temperatures during cooking
- Minimal smoke after establishing
- Long-lasting coals that maintain floor heat
- Clean burning that does not taint food

Avoid softwoods, green wood, or unknown species. Poor fuel choice causes most beginner frustrations.

### Starting the Fire

Build your fire in the centre of the oven:
1. Place crumpled newspaper or natural firelighters as base
2. Arrange kindling in a loose pyramid
3. Add small splits (3-5cm diameter) around kindling
4. Light from multiple points
5. Allow to establish before adding larger wood

Resist the urge to stack too much wood initially. Small fires grow; smothered fires struggle.

### Building Heat

Once established, gradually add larger pieces. The goal is sustained flames, not a brief inferno.

- Add one or two pieces at a time
- Wait for new wood to catch before adding more
- Keep flames active, licking the dome
- Push fire toward the back or side as floor heats

### Temperature Targets

For Neapolitan-style pizza:
- **Dome temperature**: 450-500 degrees Celsius
- **Floor temperature**: 400-450 degrees Celsius
- **Cooking time**: 60-90 seconds

For home-style pizza (thicker crust):
- **Dome temperature**: 350-400 degrees Celsius
- **Floor temperature**: 300-350 degrees Celsius
- **Cooking time**: 3-5 minutes

An infrared thermometer is invaluable for accurate readings.

### Maintaining Cooking Conditions

During a pizza session:
- Keep small flames active on one side
- Monitor floor temperature between pizzas
- Add a small piece of wood every 10-15 minutes
- Clear ash from cooking area with brush or damp cloth

The oven should feel alive with gentle flame activity, not just glowing coals.

## Dough Fundamentals

Great pizza starts with proper dough. While recipes vary, these principles are universal.

### Hydration

Pizza dough hydration (water as percentage of flour weight) affects handling and results:
- **60-62%**: Easier to handle, suitable for beginners
- **63-67%**: More extensible, better for experienced makers
- **68%+**: Very wet, challenging to handle, exceptional when mastered

Start with lower hydration until your handling improves.

### Flour Choice

For wood-fired pizza, use:
- **Type 00 flour**: The traditional choice, finely milled for tender crust
- **Bread flour**: Higher protein, good for chewy crust
- **Blend**: Many pizzaiolos mix flours for specific characteristics

Plain flour lacks the protein structure for optimal pizza dough.

### Fermentation

Extended, cold fermentation develops flavour. For best results:
- Mix dough the day before (or earlier)
- Cold ferment in refrigerator for 24-72 hours
- Bring to room temperature 2-3 hours before use

Same-day dough works in emergencies but lacks complexity.

### Shaping

This is where practice shows most:
1. Flour your work surface lightly
2. Press dough gently, working from centre outward
3. Leave a slightly thicker rim (cornicione)
4. Stretch by draping over knuckles, rotating and stretching simultaneously
5. Aim for thin centre, puffy rim
6. Work quickly; warm dough becomes sticky

Do not use a rolling pin for Neapolitan-style pizza; it eliminates the air bubbles that create texture.

## Topping Wisely

Less is more with wood-fired pizza. Excess toppings cause problems.

### Sauce Application

- Use sparingly: 2-3 tablespoons per pizza
- Spread in spiral from centre, leaving rim bare
- Use uncooked, high-quality crushed tomatoes
- Season minimally; tomatoes should taste like tomatoes

### Cheese Considerations

- Tear fresh mozzarella and drain on paper towels
- Distribute evenly but not heavily
- Full-fat, low-moisture mozzarella melts well but lacks fresh mozz's character
- Add parmesan after cooking, not before

### Topping Rules

- Cut everything thin and uniform
- Pre-cook dense vegetables (capsicum, mushroom)
- Use toppings at room temperature
- Restrain yourself: three toppings maximum plus cheese
- Add delicate herbs (basil, rocket) after cooking

Heavy, wet, or cold toppings prevent proper cooking and cause soggy centres.

## The Launch

Getting pizza into a hot oven without disaster takes practice.

### Peel Preparation

- Use semolina or fine cornmeal on the peel
- Build pizza directly on the floured peel
- Work quickly; dough sticking to peel ruins launches
- Give the peel a gentle shake before launching to confirm movement

### Launch Technique

1. Open oven door fully
2. Position peel near the back of cooking area
3. Tilt peel slightly downward
4. Pull peel back sharply while pizza slides forward
5. Close door quickly to retain heat

Practice with a slightly stiff dough first; wetter doughs are more challenging.

### Common Launch Problems

- **Dough sticks to peel**: Too long on peel, insufficient flour, wet toppings
- **Pizza folds on itself**: Peel jerked rather than smoothly withdrawn
- **Pizza lands bunched**: Peel angle too steep
- **Pizza too far back/forward**: Misjudged positioning

Every pizza maker has launch failures. Laugh, learn, and try again.

## Cooking and Turning

Once launched, active management produces best results.

### Watch Constantly

A 90-second cook time means every few seconds matter. Watch for:
- Crust puffing and browning
- Cheese melting and beginning to brown
- Bottom charring (check by lifting edge with peel)
- Toppings cooking through

### Turning

Turn the pizza 90-180 degrees partway through cooking:
- Use peel or turning tool
- Turn when the side closest to fire has charred spots
- Multiple turns ensure even cooking
- Do not turn too early; let crust set first

Without turning, you get one burnt edge and one undercooked.

### Removing

Slide peel under pizza smoothly and remove. Check bottom is cooked (some char is good; pale and soft is not).

If the top finishes before the bottom, your floor was not hot enough. If bottom chars before top cooks, reduce floor temperature or raise pizza briefly toward dome.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

Learning from others' errors accelerates your progress.

### Impatience

- Starting to cook before oven reaches temperature
- Not allowing fire to establish properly
- Rushing dough preparation or fermentation

### Over-Topping

- Too much sauce creating soggy centre
- Excessive cheese burning before base cooks
- Too many toppings preventing heat penetration

### Fuel Issues

- Using wet or green wood
- Softwood creating excessive smoke and poor heat
- Not maintaining active flames during cooking

### Temperature Mismanagement

- Letting fire die between pizzas
- Not clearing ash from cooking floor
- Ignoring temperature recovery time

### Technique

- Rolling dough eliminating air structure
- Building pizza too far from peel edge
- Hesitating during launch

## Progression Path

Expect roughly this development curve:

### First Session

Focus on fire management and basic launches. Accept imperfect results. Learn your oven's behaviour.

### Sessions 2-5

Refine dough handling. Experiment with hydration. Get comfortable with launch technique. Produce edible, improving pizzas.

### Sessions 6-15

Develop consistency. Learn to read the oven instinctively. Experiment with toppings and styles. Host pizza nights confidently.

### Ongoing

Continue refining. Explore different dough recipes. Push technique boundaries. Produce restaurant-quality results regularly.

## Equipment Worth Having

Beyond the oven itself, these tools improve results:

- **Infrared thermometer**: Accurate temperature readings
- **Metal pizza peel**: For turning and retrieving
- **Wooden launching peel**: Traditional launching surface
- **Dough scraper**: For portioning and handling
- **Proofing containers**: Proper dough management
- **Digital scale**: Accurate ingredient measurement

Start with basics and add as your practice expands.
