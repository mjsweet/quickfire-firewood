If there is one piece of advice that will most improve your firewood experience, it is this: always use properly seasoned wood. This single factor affects everything from how easily your fire starts to how much heat it produces, from how much smoke fills your yard to how safe your chimney remains.

Yet seasoning remains one of the most misunderstood aspects of firewood. Many people do not realise that green (freshly cut) wood performs dramatically differently from properly dried wood, or that "seasoned" claims from suppliers can mean vastly different things.

As firewood suppliers who take [seasoning seriously](/about), we want to explain why this matters and how to ensure you are getting properly prepared fuel.

## What is Seasoning?

Seasoning is simply the process of drying firewood after cutting. Freshly felled trees contain enormous amounts of water, often comprising 50% or more of the wood's total weight. This water must evaporate before the wood burns efficiently.

### The Drying Process

When a tree is cut:
1. Free water in cell cavities begins evaporating
2. Bound water within cell walls releases more slowly
3. Wood gradually reaches equilibrium with surrounding air humidity
4. Optimal burning moisture content (below 20%) is achieved

This process takes time. Depending on species, split size, and drying conditions, proper seasoning requires anywhere from six months to two years.

### Moisture Content Targets

Firewood moisture content is measured as a percentage of total weight:
- **Green wood**: 50-60% or higher
- **Partially seasoned**: 25-40%
- **Properly seasoned**: Below 20%
- **Ideal for burning**: 12-18%

The difference between 40% and 15% moisture content is not marginal; it is transformative for burning performance.

## Why Wet Wood Burns Poorly

Understanding the physics explains why seasoning matters so much.

### Energy Diverted to Evaporation

When wet wood burns, a significant portion of the fire's heat energy goes toward evaporating water rather than heating your space or cooking your food. This water must reach 100 degrees Celsius and convert to steam before the wood can burn properly.

With very wet wood, as much as 30-40% of the potential heat energy is lost to water evaporation. You are essentially paying for firewood and then wasting a third or more of it.

### Lower Combustion Temperatures

Water acts as a coolant. Fire temperatures cannot climb as high when constantly combating moisture. Lower temperatures mean:
- Less efficient combustion
- More incomplete burning
- Increased pollutant production
- Reduced heat output

### Increased Smoke and Emissions

Wet wood smoulders rather than burns cleanly. This produces:
- Dense, white smoke
- Unpleasant smell
- Eye and throat irritation
- Visible pollution
- Greater environmental impact

For [cooking applications](/firewood/bbq), this smoke deposits bitter, dirty flavours on food rather than the pleasant smoke notes from clean-burning dry wood.

### Difficult Ignition

Starting a fire with wet wood is frustrating. The fire struggles to establish, requires excessive kindling and firelighters, often dies out, and eventually produces disappointing results. What should be an enjoyable ritual becomes a chore.

## Safety Implications

Beyond performance, wet wood creates genuine safety concerns.

### Creosote Buildup

When wood burns at low temperatures with poor combustion, it produces creosote, a tar-like substance that deposits inside chimneys and flues. Creosote is:
- Highly flammable
- Difficult to remove
- The primary cause of chimney fires
- More prevalent with cooler, incomplete burning

Regular burning of wet wood rapidly builds dangerous creosote levels. Even with annual chimney cleaning, heavy creosote production between services creates risk.

### Carbon Monoxide

Incomplete combustion produces carbon monoxide, a colourless, odourless gas that is extremely dangerous. While well-ventilated outdoor fires present less risk, [fireplace use](/firewood/fireplaces) with wet wood and smouldering fires can elevate indoor carbon monoxide to concerning levels.

### Chimney Damage

The steam produced by burning wet wood condenses inside cooler sections of the chimney. This moisture, combined with acids from combustion, attacks masonry and metal components, accelerating deterioration and increasing maintenance costs.

## How to Identify Properly Seasoned Wood

Do not rely solely on supplier claims. Learn to assess wood yourself.

### Visual Signs

**Colour**: Seasoned wood loses its fresh-cut appearance. The ends become greyish or dull rather than bright.

**Checking**: Cracks radiating from the centre of log ends indicate drying. Green wood has smooth, crack-free end grain.

**Bark**: Loose or falling bark suggests drying. Tightly adhered bark often indicates higher moisture.

**Weight**: Seasoned wood feels surprisingly light compared to green wood of the same species. If a piece seems heavier than expected, question its dryness.

### Physical Tests

**The Sound Test**: Knock two pieces together. Seasoned wood produces a hollow, ringing sound. Wet wood sounds dull and thuddy.

**The Smell Test**: Fresh-cut wood has a strong, sappy smell. Seasoned wood has minimal odour or a light, woody scent.

**The Burn Test**: Properly seasoned wood ignites readily, burns actively, and produces clear flames. Wet wood hisses, smoulders, and produces excessive smoke.

### Moisture Meters

For certainty, use a moisture meter. These inexpensive devices (under $50) measure wood moisture content directly:
1. Split a log to expose fresh interior surface
2. Insert meter probes into the split face
3. Read moisture percentage

Measuring the interior is essential; surface moisture readings can be misleading, especially in humid climates.

## Seasoning Times by Species

Different wood species require different drying periods.

### Dense Hardwoods (Ironbark, Box)

These take longest to season properly:
- Minimum: 12 months
- Ideal: 18-24 months
- Quick-dried: Often still too wet

Dense woods hold more moisture and release it more slowly. Rushing the process produces disappointing results despite the premium species.

### Medium-Density Hardwoods (Red Gum, Spotted Gum)

- Minimum: 9-12 months
- Ideal: 12-18 months

### Lighter Hardwoods (Stringybark, Other Eucalypts)

- Minimum: 6-9 months
- Ideal: 9-12 months

These times assume proper stacking, air circulation, and protection from rain. Poor storage conditions extend required seasoning time significantly.

## The Problem With "Seasoned" Claims

When purchasing firewood, be cautious about seasoning claims.

### Variable Standards

"Seasoned" has no legal definition. Different suppliers mean different things:
- Some consider three months adequate
- Some stockpile but do not track actual drying time
- Some season fully but store improperly
- Some genuinely season to optimal moisture content

### Demand-Driven Shortcuts

During peak season, demand outstrips properly seasoned supply. Some suppliers:
- Sell partially seasoned wood as "seasoned"
- Mix green wood into seasoned loads
- Process wood to order rather than ahead of time

### Questions to Ask

When purchasing, ask:
- How long has this specific wood been seasoning?
- What species is it?
- Can you demonstrate moisture content?
- What are your storage practices?

Reputable suppliers can answer these questions specifically.

## Our Approach to Seasoning

At Quickfire Firewood, we take seasoning seriously because we understand its impact on your experience.

### Minimum 12-Month Seasoning

Our [Western Ironbark](/about) seasons for a minimum of 12 months before sale. This duration ensures moisture content consistently below 20%, regardless of the wood's starting condition.

### Proper Storage Throughout

During seasoning, our wood is:
- Stacked for optimal air circulation
- Protected from rain while allowing airflow
- Stored on elevated surfaces
- Rotated to ensure oldest stock sells first

### Consistent Species

By focusing on one species, we understand its characteristics thoroughly. We know how Ironbark behaves during seasoning and can assess readiness accurately.

### Customer Confidence

When you receive firewood from us, you can trust it is ready to burn. No guesswork, no disappointment, no need to store for additional months before use.

## Storing Your Firewood

Once you have quality, seasoned wood, maintain its condition through proper storage. Read our detailed guide on [storing firewood in Queensland's climate](/blog/2026-03-28-how-to-store-firewood-properly-in-queenslands-climate) for complete information.

Key principles:
- Elevate off the ground
- Protect from rain but allow airflow
- Position for air circulation
- Store away from house walls
- Use oldest wood first

Even perfectly seasoned wood can absorb moisture if stored poorly, especially in Queensland's humidity.

## Applications Where Seasoning Matters Most

Some uses demand properly seasoned wood more critically than others.

### Pizza Ovens

[Pizza oven cooking](/firewood/pizza-ovens) requires extremely high temperatures. Wet wood simply cannot achieve or maintain proper pizza cooking heat. The difference between good and poor seasoning is the difference between successful and failed pizza sessions.

### Indoor Fireplaces

[Fireplace use](/firewood/fireplaces) concentrates smoke in enclosed spaces. Wet wood produces smoke that backs into homes, stains walls and ceilings, triggers smoke alarms, and creates unpleasant living conditions. Safety concerns from creosote are also most acute with indoor burning.

### BBQ and Smoking

[Low and slow cooking](/firewood/bbq) depends on clean smoke for hours at a stretch. Dirty, wet smoke from improperly seasoned wood deposits bitter, acrid flavours that ruin expensive cuts. Serious pitmasters are fanatical about wood quality.

### Fire Pits

While [fire pit use](/firewood/fire-pits) is more forgiving than indoor burning, wet wood still creates excessive smoke that annoys guests and neighbours, struggles to produce adequate heat, and requires constant attention rather than relaxed enjoyment.

## The Value of Quality

Properly seasoned premium firewood costs more than hastily processed green wood. Is it worth it?

Consider:
- **Heat output**: You get significantly more usable heat per kilogram
- **Convenience**: Fires start easily and burn reliably
- **Safety**: Reduced creosote, reduced risk
- **Enjoyment**: Clean fires without smoke problems
- **Cooking results**: Clean smoke enhances rather than ruins food

Per unit of useful heat delivered, quality seasoned wood often costs less than cheap wet wood, while providing dramatically better experience.

## Choose Quality Seasoning

When purchasing firewood, prioritise seasoning above almost everything else. Properly seasoned lesser species outperforms poorly seasoned premium wood.

We supply [properly seasoned Western Ironbark](/order) throughout Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Every load has seasoned for a minimum of 12 months, ensuring you receive wood ready for optimal performance.
