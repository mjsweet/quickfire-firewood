Commercial wood-fired cooking operates under different pressures than residential use. When your business reputation depends on consistent quality, when customers pay premium prices expecting premium results, and when service timing cannot accommodate fuel problems, your firewood supply becomes a critical operational concern.

We supply firewood to [restaurants, pizzerias, and BBQ venues](/commercial) throughout Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Through these partnerships, we have developed deep understanding of what commercial kitchens require from their wood supply. This guide covers the essential considerations for professional operations.

## Why Commercial Requirements Differ

Home cooks can adapt to fuel variations. Commercial kitchens cannot.

### Consistency is Non-Negotiable

A restaurant producing wood-fired pizzas needs every pie to cook identically. Customers who love the margherita one visit expect the same experience next time. Variables in fuel quality create variables in output quality, and in hospitality, inconsistency loses customers.

This means:
- Same species, every delivery
- Same moisture content, every delivery
- Same sizing, every delivery
- Same burning characteristics, every delivery

### Volume Requirements

Commercial operations burn significantly more wood than residential users. A busy pizzeria might consume several hundred kilograms weekly during peak periods. This volume requires:
- Reliable supply that does not run short
- Delivery scheduling that accommodates operations
- Storage solutions handling large quantities
- Pricing that works for business economics

### Food Safety Compliance

Commercial kitchens operate under food safety regulations. Fuel used near food must be:
- Free from contaminants
- Untreated and uncoated
- Clearly identified species
- Stored appropriately

Unknown wood scraps or treated timber offcuts are not acceptable alternatives, regardless of cost savings.

## Species Selection for Commercial Use

Different cooking styles have different wood requirements.

### Pizza Ovens

Commercial pizza ovens demand wood that:
- Reaches cooking temperature (400-500 degrees Celsius) rapidly
- Maintains consistent high heat throughout service
- Burns cleanly without excessive smoke
- Produces quality coals that hold floor temperature
- Does not spark excessively into the cooking area

[Western Ironbark](/firewood/pizza-ovens) excels for pizza because its density delivers sustained high temperatures while burning cleanly. Many Brisbane pizzerias have standardised on Ironbark precisely because it meets these demands.

### Chargrill and BBQ

Wood-fired grills require:
- High heat for searing
- Quality coals for extended cooking
- Clean smoke that enhances flavour
- Consistent sizing for predictable performance
- Reliable burn time per piece

For [BBQ smoking operations](/firewood/bbq), coal longevity becomes even more critical. Low and slow cooking over many hours needs wood that produces sustained heat without constant attention.

### General Wood-Fired Cooking

Rotisseries, wood-fired ovens, and other applications need:
- Appropriate heat for the specific cooking method
- Clean burning that does not taint food
- Predictable behaviour for timing calculations
- Safe combustion without excessive sparking

### Hearth and Ambiance

Some restaurants feature wood fires for atmosphere rather than cooking. These require:
- Clean burning with minimal smoke
- Attractive flame appearance
- Low spark emission in dining environments
- Easy ignition and maintenance

## Sizing Specifications

Consistent sizing matters for operational efficiency.

### Pizza Oven Splits

Standard pizza oven wood:
- Length: 25-35cm (to fit oven opening)
- Diameter: 5-10cm (quick ignition, responsive heat)
- Kindling: Separate supply of smaller pieces for fire building

Uniform sizing means staff can predict how many pieces achieve target temperature and maintain it.

### Chargrill Pieces

For grill operations:
- Length: Appropriate for firebox dimensions
- Diameter: 8-15cm (longer burn time per piece)
- Consistency: Similar sizing across delivery

### Custom Requirements

Every kitchen configuration differs slightly. We offer [custom splitting](/order) to match your specific equipment dimensions and operational preferences.

## Quality Standards

Commercial operations should expect and demand high standards.

### Moisture Content

Properly seasoned wood (below 20% moisture content) is essential for:
- Rapid temperature achievement during service
- Clean burning without excessive smoke
- Predictable heat output per piece
- Food safety (wet wood produces dirty smoke)

Our Ironbark [seasons for a minimum of 12 months](/about) before supply to commercial customers.

### Species Purity

Mixed species create inconsistency. Commercial supplies should be:
- Single, identified species
- From consistent source regions
- Free from unidentified inclusions
- Documented for traceability

### Cleanliness

Commercial firewood should be:
- Free from soil contamination
- Without mould or fungal growth
- Clear of insects
- Appropriately stored between processing and delivery

### Documentation

Some operations, particularly those with compliance requirements, need:
- Species identification
- Source information
- Moisture content verification
- Supply chain documentation

## Supply Logistics

Reliable supply prevents service disruptions.

### Volume Planning

Work with your supplier to establish:
- Weekly or monthly consumption estimates
- Seasonal variation patterns
- Peak period requirements
- Minimum stock levels to maintain

Planning prevents emergency orders at premium prices.

### Delivery Scheduling

Commercial deliveries should:
- Arrive at operationally convenient times
- Avoid disrupting service periods
- Accommodate receiving staff availability
- Include unloading assistance if required

We schedule deliveries to suit restaurant operations, understanding that midday deliveries during lunch service create problems.

### Backup Planning

Smart operations maintain:
- Sufficient storage for multiple weeks
- Secondary supplier relationships for emergencies
- Communication channels with primary supplier
- Understanding of lead times for reordering

## Storage for Commercial Operations

Proper storage protects your investment and maintains quality.

### Dedicated Storage Area

Commercial firewood storage should be:
- Covered from weather but ventilated
- Accessible for deliveries and restocking
- Near point of use for efficiency
- Compliant with fire regulations regarding fuel storage

### Stock Rotation

Use oldest stock first. Commercial operations receiving regular deliveries need systems ensuring proper rotation to maintain optimal moisture levels.

### Fire Safety

Large wood quantities near commercial kitchens require:
- Adequate separation from cooking areas
- Compliance with local fire codes
- Proper ventilation
- Clear access for emergency services

Consult local regulations regarding combustible storage near commercial premises.

### Indoor Storage

Some operations store limited quantities indoors for convenience. Keep these amounts small, maintain proper fire separation, and ensure stocks do not create hygiene issues.

## Cost Considerations

Commercial firewood purchasing differs from residential transactions.

### True Cost Analysis

The cheapest wood per tonne rarely represents the best value. Consider:
- Heat output per kilogram (denser, drier wood produces more heat)
- Consistency (inconsistent wood wastes staff time)
- Reliability (running short costs more than premium wood)
- Quality impact (poor fuel affects food quality)

Properly seasoned premium hardwood often costs less per unit of useful heat than cheap, wet alternatives.

### Bulk Pricing

Larger, regular orders typically attract better pricing. Establish ongoing supply arrangements rather than spot purchasing.

### Operational Efficiency

Good fuel saves money through:
- Less fuel consumed per service (higher heat output)
- Reduced staff time managing fires
- Fewer complaints and remakes from inconsistent cooking
- Better equipment longevity from clean burning

Factor these savings against headline fuel prices.

## Working With Suppliers

The right supplier relationship simplifies operations.

### What to Look For

Choose suppliers who:
- Understand commercial requirements
- Offer consistent, identified species
- Can document seasoning practices
- Provide reliable delivery schedules
- Communicate proactively about availability
- Respond quickly to urgent needs
- Have references from similar businesses

### Communication

Maintain open communication regarding:
- Upcoming busy periods requiring extra stock
- Any quality concerns with delivered wood
- Changing operational requirements
- Feedback on what works well

Good suppliers value feedback and improve based on it.

### Building Partnership

Long-term supplier relationships provide:
- Priority service during high-demand periods
- Understanding of your specific requirements
- Proactive communication about potential issues
- Flexibility when circumstances change
- Consistent quality through established expectations
