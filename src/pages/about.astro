        Our Story
      </h2>

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-base-content/80">
        <p>
          We are Jane and John, and we have been supplying premium firewood to families and
          businesses across South East Queensland for years. What started as a passion for
          quality wood-fired cooking has grown into a business built on one simple idea:
          <strong>provide the kind of firewood we would want to burn ourselves</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before we started Quickfire Firewood, we were customers ourselves. We knew the
          frustration of ordering firewood only to receive damp, green wood that smoked more
          than it burned. We experienced the disappointment of "mixed hardwood" that was
          anything but premium. And we understood the difference that truly quality firewood
          makes to a fire.
        </p>

        <p>So we decided to do something about it.</p>

            Why We Focus on Western Ironbark
          </h2>

          <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-base-content/80">
            <p>
              When we set out to supply firewood, we wanted to offer the best - not the cheapest,
              not the most convenient to source, but genuinely the best burning wood available.
              That led us to Western Ironbark.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ironbark is one of Australia's densest and hardest timbers. It burns longer,
              produces more heat, and creates better coals than lighter hardwoods. For
              wood-fired cooking, it is unmatched. For home heating, it means fewer logs and
              more warmth. For fire pits, it creates those beautiful glowing embers that last
              well into the night.
            </p>

            <p>
              We source our Ironbark responsibly and take the time to season it properly.
              Every load that leaves our yard has been dried for at least 12 months, ensuring
              you receive firewood that is genuinely ready to burn.
