        <p>
          When wood-fired cooking is central to your business, you cannot afford inconsistent
          firewood. Green wood that will not burn properly. Deliveries that do not arrive when
          promised. Quality that varies from order to order.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Quickfire Firewood, we understand what commercial kitchens need:{" "}
          <strong>
            consistent quality, reliable supply, and firewood that performs exactly as expected,
            every single time
          </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We supply premium Western Ironbark to restaurants, pizzerias, BBQ venues, and
          commercial kitchens throughout Brisbane and the Gold Coast.
