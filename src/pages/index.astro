          Quality Firewood for Every Fire
        </h2>

        <p class="text-center text-base-content/80 text-lg mb-8">
          Whether you are warming your home on a winter evening, perfecting your wood-fired pizza,
          smoking a brisket, or gathering around the fire pit with friends, the right firewood
          makes all the difference.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center text-base-content/80 text-lg mb-8">
          At Quickfire Firewood, we supply <strong>premium Western Ironbark</strong> - one of
          Australia's finest burning hardwoods. Our firewood is properly seasoned for 12 months
          or more, ensuring clean burns, excellent heat output, and that satisfying crackle
          that brings any fire to life.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center text-base-content/80 text-lg">
          We are {SITE_CONFIG.owners}, and we have built our family business on one simple principle:
          <strong>supply the firewood we would want to burn ourselves</strong>. That means no
          green wood, no dodgy mixes, and no shortcuts on quality.
